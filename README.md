# Chat-Room

(This is a program I wrote long time ago, being modified now by rearranging the structure for both server and client, and by adding a thread pool for server to speedup.

2021.2.24

Create two inner classes for client to handle sending and listening function. And 160 lines -> 120 lines, yes! Good-bye previous \*\*\*\*.

Modifying server class.
