# Chat-Room

(This is a program I wrote long time ago, to be modified now by adding a thread pool and maybe simplifying some logic)

**This is a multi-thread chat room program which can support the chating of several users, you can also:**
- Filter bad words
- Broadcast to all users
- send message to a specific user
